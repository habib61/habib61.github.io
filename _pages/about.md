I am postdoctoral research scientist with joint affiliations to [medical research council](https://www.har.mrc.ac.uk/) (MRC) at Harwell and university of [oxford statistic department](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/). I obtained my Ph.D. in statistic from university of Warwick under the supervision of [Prof. Tom Nichols](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/t-e-nichols). My thesis was on developing statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional neuroimaging data. 



# Research
I am interested in developing and applying computational statistic and machine learning methods for analysing heterogeneous big datasets that contain different data modalities. My research is primarily focused on developing multivariate statistical methods to enhance interpretation of data from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). I am also working on developing modelling methods for brain imaging data to predict different health outcomes from imaging and non-imaging while controlling for individual differences in environmental and genomic data using the UKBiobank.
